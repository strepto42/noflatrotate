A simple app to disable rotation when a device is nearly flat, then re-enable it when it is no longer flat.

Born from me getting the shits with my devices rotating to landscape just as I laid them down.

Needs more work, config options, keepalive stuff, and tweaking as it's a bit rough around the edges right now, but as a POC it works.
